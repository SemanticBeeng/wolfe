We have released the 0.1.0 version of Wolfe. This version supports very basic, slow and poorly
tested support for

* generic structured prediction models and MRFs with discrete variables.
* discriminative loss functions for training
* Max-Product MAP inference / decoding

Check the [beginnings of Wolfe documentation](http://moro.wolfe.ml:9000/doc/wolfe-static/wolfe/docs/gettingstarted/01_welcome)
for basic instructions on installation and usage.
