We leverage Gurobi as (I)LP solver, which is currently the fastest existing solver (http://scip.zib.de/, http://plato.asu.edu/ftp/milpc.html).

Gurobi offers a free academic license. In the following, we provide installation instructions for Gurobi and advises how to integrate Gurobi into Wulfe.

Register
========
Register at http://www.gurobi.com/. You need to give a valid mail address from a university. Login to your account.

Download
========
Download the newest Gurobi version for your specific platform (click on the checkbox with the ”readme” file) and install it.

Settings
========
Linux Set the following environment variables (add for example in the following lines to the hidden .bashrc in your home directory):

export GUROBI_HOME="/home/ubuntu/gurobi461/linux32"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"

Windows Make sure that the environment variable grb home is set correctly and that the bin directory of your Gurobi installation is included in the ”path“ environment variable.

License
=======
Order a Free Academic License in your Gurobi account (account from step 2.1, click on Licenses and Free Academic and follow the instructions). Execute (via command line) the command you got from the Free Academic Licence. It says
something like: grbgetkey xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. In case you store the license key to a non default location, follow this instruction:

You have saved your license key to a non-default location. You will need to set environment variable GRB LICENSE FILE to value your/directory/gurobi.lic before you can use this license key.

Provide Jar File
================
Copy the gurobi.jar file from your GUROBI/lib directory to the wulfe/lib directory.

Enable Specs
============
After installation you might want to enable ILP related specs. The main ILP spec is located in src/test/scala/.../ILPSpecs.scala.
The spec for solving ILP with MessagePassing is integrated in src/test/scala/.../MapInferenceSpecs.scala. Search for "TODO Enable, if Gurobi installed!", and
uncomment the respective parts.

Getting Started
===============
At the moment, Wulfe comes with an ILP Inteface and an algorithm to solve message passing trees with ILP. Examples of the usage can be found in GurobiILPConnectorExample and MPwithILPExample, respectively. Both are located in the ilp package.
